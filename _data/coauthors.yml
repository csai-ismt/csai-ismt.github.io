    description: Hi! I'm Eva, an Assistant Professor at Tilburg University's Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, where I research Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with a specific focus on preserving linguistic diversity and avoiding gender bias. My journey in this field began at Dublin City University in Ireland, where I developed a passion for integrating linguistic features into NMT during my PhD. Feel free to drop me a message if you are interested in any of these topics and would like to collaborate!
