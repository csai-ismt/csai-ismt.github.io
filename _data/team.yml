    bio: "Hi! I’m Mirella, an Assistant Professor at Tilburg University’s Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence and a member of the SignON project. My research focuses on Sign Language Machine Translation; in particular, I research how Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can be extended to sign languages by taking into account their linguistic properties. My background is in linguistics (phonology) and computational literary studies. In general, I like to find connections between different disciplines and topics. If you would like to collaborate (or just discuss something), feel free to get in touch with me."

    bio: "Hallo! I'm Fred, an Assistant Professor in AI at Tilburg University's Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence, where I research Neural Machine Translation (NMT) with a specific focus on Quality Estimation. I am also interested in the cognitive workflow induced in human post-editing of Machine Translation (MT) and human interpreting. I worked on incremental adapation of Statistical MT (SMT) during my PhD and was involved in several EU funded projects after that (namely <a href='https://www.matecat.com/' target=_blank>MateCAT</a>, <a href='https://qt21.eu' target=_blank>QT21</a>, <a href='https://browser.mt' target=_blank>BrowserMT</a> and others). I joined TiU after being a postdoctoral researcher at The University of Sheffield and a Senior Lecturer at The University of Wolverhampton, in the UK. Get in touch if you are interested in collaborating or are doing a PhD on topics such as Neural MT, Quality Estimation, Post-Editing, as well as exploring Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction for Human Interpreting."

    bio: "Hi! I am Lisa Lepp, Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) of Tilburg University’s, where I am joining the Machine Translation Group (ISMT). My Ph.D.-project is titled: ''Human factors in Sign Language Machine Translation''.  There are three multi-disciplinarity’s involved: Linguistics, Community and Technology. With this project we try (i) to extend the current state-of-the-art in MT with the capacity to recognize and reason with articulators of the Sign Language of the Netherlands (SLN / NGT) and (ii) a co-creation approach with an open science communication with the deaf and hearing society. 
<br />
Before joining Tilburg University, I was student-assistant of former-professor Onno Crasborn, and I worked as a teacher of deaf refugee children. I earned my BSc in the Dutch Language and Culture, and focused my MSc on General Linguistics with as specialization Sign Linguistics. During my master’s thesis, I analyzed the influence of phonological complexity in lexical items on the language acquisition process of late first learners of Sign Language of the Netherlands (SLN/ NGT), under the supervisor of Dr. B. Sümer and Dr. R. Pfau (as second supervisor)."
